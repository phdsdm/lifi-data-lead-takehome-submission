-- 167_stablecoin_pair_floor
-- Question: What does a minimum rate on stablecoin-to-stablecoin pairs add at 1, 2 and 5 bps?
-- Grain:    one row per (basis, scope, floor). Scope 'source-step rows' is the volume that already carries a
--           source step; 'all bridge volume' adds the no-step stablecoin pairs, where a floor would
--           first need a fee step. Rates above the floor stay. Basis 'pooled' as query 166.
-- Definitions applied (the same in every query of this family):
--   - Bridge volume: started rows in headline amount_usd, without the 295 same-chain
--     *Dex rows; the 4 unpriced rows carry no USD and fall out. Reference data: every fee, route
--     kind and token below comes from LI.FI /v1/status snapshots; amount_usd may be CoinGecko-filled.
--   - Paying LI.FI: fee_split_lifi_usd above 0 on the quote. Quote fee as fee charged. Weekly "completed" and annual: × completion 98.20% (query 44) and × 52; volume
--     held fixed. "Quoted" means before completion.
--   - Route kind: no source step = hasSourceSwaps false; fee step only = sending_included_tools
--     exactly 'feeCollection'; DEX step = anything else with the flag true. The fee step itself
--     sets hasSourceSwaps, so the flag does not mean "swap".
--   - Same token: sending and receiving symbols match after merging USDC with USDC.e, USDCe, USDbC,
--     axlUSDC; USDT with USD₮0, USDT0; ETH with WETH; BNB with WBNB; POL with WPOL, MATIC, WMATIC.
--     Bridge-only = same token, cross-chain, no DEX step. Cross-chain is read from the event's
--     destinationChainId, never from the receiving leg: a refund on the source chain stays
--     in bridge volume, and its receiving symbol is compared as recorded, so a refund in the token
--     sent counts as same token. A missing receiving symbol (2 refunded strata rows) is not same
--     token, and its pair class comes from the sending symbol alone.
--   - Token class: ref_token_class (data/reference/token_class.csv); a symbol not in it is alt. A
--     pair is alt if either side is alt, else major if either side is major, else stable.
--   - Estimator, one weight w per observed row, so a sum over rows of w × value is the
--     file-level figure. Source-step rows: at $10k and above, the census (in_census), w = 1, exact;
--     under $10k, the raw integrator string's in_strata rows under $10k, w = the string's under-$10k
--     volume in the file / the same rows' USD, the ratio estimate. No-source-step rows are zero (0 of
--     627, query 75; 0 of 309, query 150): at $100k and above the census (w = 1, exact); under
--     $100k the uniform 2,000's no-step rows, w = the file's no-step volume in the size band / the
--     sampled rows' USD in it, bands under $10k and $10k to $100k (621 rows, 29 in the upper band).
--     Rate mixtures stay as observed, row by row, in proportion to their USD among the sampled rows;
--     no rate is merged or modelled. moby's integrator fee is a fixed amount:
--     where the integrator fee is summed, its strata rows take rows in file / rows sampled. The 27
--     strata rows on bridge volume without a quote count as paying nothing (query 159 sizes it).
--   - Increase, not level: a size is the increase on today's LI.FI fee. A floor is max(floor × amount
--     - LI.FI fee, 0) row by row on the sampled rows, then weighted, so rates above the floor stay.
-- Inputs:   transfers_priced; ref_integrator_map; ref_token_class; ref_lifi_api_transfer_status_extension,
--           ref_lifi_api_transfer_status_bridge_census and ref_lifi_api_transfer_status_sample_2600 (reference
--           data: LI.FI /v1/status, fetched 2026-10-28 and 2026-11-01). Quoted fee, not fee collected.
